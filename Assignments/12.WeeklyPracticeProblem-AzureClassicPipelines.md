# Assignment: Setting Up Azure Repos and Pipelines for Terraform Deployment

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to set up an Azure repository with a specific folder structure and create two Azure DevOps pipelines to deploy infrastructure to separate development and production environments using Terraform.

## Steps to Complete the Assignment

## 1. Create Azure Repository with Folder Structure

1. **Navigate to Azure DevOps Project:**
   - Open your Azure DevOps project.

2. **Create a New Repository:**
   - Go to **Repos** and select **Files**.
   - Click on **New** and select **Repository**.
   - Name the repository, for example, `Terraform-Infrastructure`.

3. **Set Up Folder Structure:**
   - In the newly created repository, create the following folder structure:
     ```
     environments
         dev
         prod
     ```

4. **Add Terraform Configuration Files:**
   - In the `dev` folder, create two files: `main.tf` and `provider.tf`.
   - In the `prod` folder, create two files: `main.tf` and `provider.tf`.
   - Populate these files with appropriate Terraform code to define the infrastructure for the development and production environments.

## 2. Create Pipelines for Deployment

1. **Navigate to Pipelines:**
   - Go to **Pipelines** in your Azure DevOps project.

2. **Create a Pipeline for Development Environment:**
   - Click on **New Pipeline**.
   - Select **Use the classic editor**.
   - Choose the repository `Terraform-Infrastructure`.
   - Choose the template **Empty job**.
   - Name the pipeline, e.g., `Dev Deployment Pipeline`.
   - Add tasks for Terraform installation, initialization, planning, and applying.
   - Configure the tasks to point to the `environments/dev` folder.
   - Set up any necessary service connections for authentication with Azure.
   - Save and queue the pipeline.

3. **Create a Pipeline for Production Environment:**
   - Repeat the above steps to create another pipeline.
   - Name this pipeline, e.g., `Prod Deployment Pipeline`.
   - Configure the tasks to point to the `environments/prod` folder.
   - Ensure service connections are correctly set up for the production environment.
   - Save and queue the pipeline.

## 3. Verify Deployment

1. **Run the Development Pipeline:**
   - Trigger the `Dev Deployment Pipeline` and verify that the infrastructure is deployed correctly in the development environment.

2. **Run the Production Pipeline:**
   - Trigger the `Prod Deployment Pipeline` and verify that the infrastructure is deployed correctly in the production environment.

# Deliverables

- Azure repository named `Terraform-Infrastructure` with the specified folder structure.
- `main.tf` and `provider.tf` files in both `dev` and `prod` folders containing the Terraform configuration.
- Two Azure DevOps pipelines: `Dev Deployment Pipeline` and `Prod Deployment Pipeline`, configured to deploy infrastructure to the respective environments.

# Notes

- Ensure that the Terraform code in `main.tf` and `provider.tf` is appropriate for your Azure environment and includes necessary resources.
- Properly configure service connections in Azure DevOps for secure access to your Azure subscription.
- Test both pipelines thoroughly to ensure they deploy the infrastructure as expected without errors.

Complete the assignment and provide the necessary screenshots or logs to demonstrate the successful deployment of infrastructure in both development and production environments.
