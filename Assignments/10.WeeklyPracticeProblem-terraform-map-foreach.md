### Assignment 1 : Creating Azure Resource Groups in West US Region using Terraform (List/Set and foreach)

#### Objective:
- Create a Terraform configuration that defines multiple resource groups in the West US region using a list and the `for_each` meta-argument.

#### Instructions:
1. Define a list containing the names of the resource groups to be created in the West US region.
2. Use the `for_each` meta-argument with the `azurerm_resource_group` resource to create resource groups based on the list.
3. Ensure that each resource group has a unique name and is located in the West US region.


#### Example Code:
```hcl
variable "resource_group_names" {
  type    = list(string)
  default = ["rg1", "rg2", "rg3"]
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "resource_groups" {
  for_each = var.resource_group_names

  name     = each.key
  location = "West US"
}
```

#### Submission:
- Students should submit the Terraform configuration files along with a brief explanation of how the list and `for_each` meta-argument were used to create the resource groups in the West US region.


# Assignment 2 : Creating Azure Storage Accounts using Terraform (Map and foreach)

## Objective:
- Create a Terraform configuration that defines a storage account and creates three instances of this storage account using a single complex map and the `for_each` meta-argument.

## Instructions:
1. Define a complex map containing the configurations for three storage accounts. Each entry in the map should include the following:
   - `name`: Name of the storage account.
   - `resource_group`: Name of the resource group where the storage account will be created.
   - `location`: Location for the storage account.
   - `account_tier`: The performance tier for the storage account (e.g., "Standard", "Premium").
   - `account_replication_type`: The replication type for the storage account (e.g., "LRS", "GRS").

2. Use the `for_each` meta-argument with the `azurerm_storage_account` resource to create three instances of the storage account based on the complex map.

3. Ensure that the Terraform configuration is modular and follows best practices for readability and maintainability.

## Example Code:
main.tf
```hcl
variable "storage_accounts" {}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "storage_accounts" {
  for_each = var.storage_accounts

  name                     = each.key
  resource_group_name      = each.value.resource_group
  location                 = each.value.location
  account_tier             = each.value.account_tier
  account_replication_type = each.value.account_replication_type

  account_kind = "StorageV2"
}

```

terraform.tfvars
```hcl
storage_accounts_config = {
    account1 = {
      resource_group           = "my-rg"
      location                 = "East US"
      account_tier             = "Standard"
      account_replication_type = "LRS"
    },
    account2 = {
      resource_group           = "my-rg"
      location                 = "West US"
      account_tier             = "Standard"
      account_replication_type = "GRS"
    },
    account3 = {
      resource_group           = "my-rg"
      location                 = "Central US"
      account_tier             = "Premium"
      account_replication_type = "LRS"
    }
  }
```

## Submission:
- Students should submit the Terraform configuration files along with a brief explanation of how the `for_each` meta-argument and complex maps were used to create the storage accounts.

## Note:
- Students can further enhance this assignment by adding additional configuration options for the storage accounts, such as networking settings, encryption, and access controls.
