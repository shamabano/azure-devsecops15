# Terraform Variables Assignment

## Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to understand the concept of variables in Terraform, their declaration, assignment, and usage, as well as various methods of passing variable values.

## Instructions:
1. Define a Terraform configuration for creating an Azure resource group with the following specifications:
   - Use variables to define the resource group name and location.
   - Use a variable for the resource group name with a default value.
   - Use a variable for the location with a default value of "West Europe".

2. Create the resource group using the variables defined in step 1.

3. Use the following methods to pass variable values:
   - Pass variable values directly through the CLI using the `-var` flag.
   - Use `.tfvars` files to pass variable values.
   - Utilize the `terraform.tfvars` file to automatically load variable values.

4. Verify the resource group creation by running `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`.

## Submission:
Submit the Terraform configuration files (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `terraform.tfvars`, and any `.tfvars` files used) along with a screenshot of the output after running `terraform apply`.

## Note:
Ensure that your Terraform configuration is organized and follows best practices for readability and maintainability.
