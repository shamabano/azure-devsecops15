## Azure DevOps

**Azure DevOps** is a suite of development tools from Microsoft to support software development teams in planning, developing, delivering, and maintaining their software projects. It provides an integrated set of features that you can access through your web browser or IDE client, including:

1. **Azure Boards**: Agile tools for planning, tracking, and discussing work across teams.
2. **Azure Repos**: Git repositories or Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) for source control of your code.
3. **Azure Pipelines**: Build, test, and deploy with CI/CD that works with any language, platform, and cloud.
4. **Azure Test Plans**: Tools to capture and analyze test results.
5. **Azure Artifacts**: Share Maven, npm, NuGet, and Python packages from public and private sources.

## Azure Service Connection

**Azure Service Connection** is a resource within Azure DevOps that provides a secure way to connect Azure DevOps to your Azure subscription or other Azure resources. This connection is necessary for deploying your applications to Azure from Azure DevOps pipelines.

## Azure Service Principal

**Azure Service Principal** is an identity created for use with applications, hosted services, and automated tools to access Azure resources. It is essentially an identity that can be assigned to an Azure Service Connection to authenticate and authorize Azure DevOps to perform actions on your Azure resources.

## Process of Creating Azure Service Connections and Azure Service Principals

## Creating an Azure Service Principal

1. **Log into Azure Portal**:
   - Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. **Navigate to Azure Active Directory**:
   - In the left-hand navigation pane, select "Azure Active Directory".

3. **Create a new App Registration**:
   - Under "Manage", select "App registrations" and click "New registration".
   - Fill in the required fields (Name, Supported account types, Redirect URI).
   - Click "Register".

4. **Generate Client Secret**:
   - After registration, navigate to the "Certificates & secrets" section.
   - Click "New client secret" and provide a description and expiration period.
   - Save the client secret value immediately as it will be needed later.

5. **Assign Roles to the Service Principal**:
   - Go to your subscription or resource group where you want to assign roles.
   - Select "Access control (IAM)".
   - Click "Add" and then "Add role assignment".
   - Choose the appropriate role (e.g., Contributor) and assign it to the service principal by searching for the name of the app registration.

## Creating an Azure Service Connection in Azure DevOps

1. **Navigate to Azure DevOps**:
   - Go to your Azure DevOps organization and project.

2. **Service Connections**:
   - Select "Project settings" in the lower left corner.
   - Under "Pipelines", select "Service connections".

3. **Add a New Service Connection**:
   - Click "New service connection" and select "Azure Resource Manager".
   - Choose "Service principal (automatic)" for Azure DevOps to automatically set up the service principal, or choose "Service principal (manual)" to enter the details manually.

4. **Service Principal (Automatic)**:
   - Follow the prompts to authenticate and authorize Azure DevOps to create the service principal on your behalf.

5. **Service Principal (Manual)**:
   - Enter the following details:
     - Subscription ID
     - Subscription Name
     - Service Principal ID (Application ID from the app registration)
     - Service Principal Key (Client Secret from the app registration)
     - Tenant ID (Directory ID from Azure Active Directory)

6. **Verify and Finish**:
   - Click "Verify" to ensure the connection is valid.
   - Provide a name for the service connection and click "Save".

## Summary

- **Azure DevOps** provides tools for CI/CD, source control, and project management.
- **Azure Service Connection** allows secure connections between Azure DevOps and Azure resources.
- **Azure Service Principal** is an identity for applications to access Azure resources.
- **Creating a Service Principal** involves registering an app in Azure AD, generating a client secret, and assigning roles.
- **Creating a Service Connection** in Azure DevOps involves using the service principal credentials to establish the connection.

These steps ensure secure and efficient deployment pipelines from Azure DevOps to Azure services.
