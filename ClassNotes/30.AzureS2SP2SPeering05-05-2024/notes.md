# How to Create Azure VNet Peering Using Terraform

1. **Define the VNets**:
   ```hcl
   resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "vnet1" {
     name                = "vnet1"
     address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
     location            = "West US"
     resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
   }

   resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "vnet2" {
     name                = "vnet2"
     address_space       = ["10.1.0.0/16"]
     location            = "East US"
     resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
   }
   ```

2. **Create the VNet Peerings**:
   ```hcl
   resource "azurerm_virtual_network_peering" "vnet1_to_vnet2" {
     name                         = "vnet1-to-vnet2"
     resource_group_name          = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
     virtual_network_name         = azurerm_virtual_network.vnet1.name
     remote_virtual_network_id    = azurerm_virtual_network.vnet2.id
     allow_virtual_network_access = true
     allow_forwarded_traffic      = true
     allow_gateway_transit        = false
     use_remote_gateways          = false
   }

   resource "azurerm_virtual_network_peering" "vnet2_to_vnet1" {
     name                         = "vnet2-to-vnet1"
     resource_group_name          = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
     virtual_network_name         = azurerm_virtual_network.vnet2.name
     remote_virtual_network_id    = azurerm_virtual_network.vnet1.id
     allow_virtual_network_access = true
     allow_forwarded_traffic      = true
     allow_gateway_transit        = false
     use_remote_gateways          = false
   }
   ```

3. **Apply the Configuration**:
   Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` to create the VNet peering connections.

Remember to replace `azurerm_resource_group.example.name` with the actual name of your resource group.

4. **Verify the Peering**:
   After applying the configuration, you can verify the peering connections in the Azure portal or using the Azure CLI.

5. **Update the Peering**:
   To update the peering configuration, you can modify the Terraform configuration and reapply it. For example, you can enable or disable specific features like `allow_gateway_transit` or `allow_forwarded_traffic`.

6. **Destroy the Peering**:
   If you no longer need the peering connections, you can destroy them using Terraform:
   ```hcl
   resource "azurerm_virtual_network_peering" "vnet1_to_vnet2" {
     name                = "vnet1-to-vnet2"
     resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
     virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.vnet1.name
     remote_virtual_network_id = azurerm_virtual_network.vnet2.id

     # Other settings...
     destroy = true
   }

   resource "azurerm_virtual_network_peering" "vnet2_to_vnet1" {
     name                = "vnet2-to-vnet1"
     resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
     virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.vnet2.name
     remote_virtual_network_id = azurerm_virtual_network.vnet1.id

     # Other settings...
     destroy = true
   }
   ```

7. **Additional Configuration**:
   - You can add more VNets and create peering connections between them in a similar manner.
   - Ensure that the address spaces of the VNets do not overlap to avoid routing issues.

This is a basic guide to creating Azure VNet peering using Terraform. Adjust the configuration as per your requirements and best practices.
