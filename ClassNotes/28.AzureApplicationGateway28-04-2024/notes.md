# Azure Application Gateway 🚀

Azure Application Gateway is a Layer-7 (Application Layer) load balancing service that is specifically designed for handling HTTP/HTTPS traffic. It offers advanced routing, SSL termination, web application firewall (WAF) capabilities, and more, making it suitable for web applications with complex traffic management requirements.

🌐 **HTTP Load Balancing**: It intelligently routes traffic based on URL path, host headers, and other HTTP attributes.

🔐 **SSL Offloading**: Application Gateway can handle SSL/TLS encryption and decryption, reducing the workload on backend servers.

🛡️ **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Provides protection against common web application vulnerabilities and attacks.

🍪 **Cookie-Based Affinity**: Supports session affinity based on HTTP cookies.

🔄 **Rewrite and Redirection**: You can perform URL rewrite and redirection for incoming requests.

🚀 **Auto-Scaling**: Application Gateway can automatically scale based on demand to handle traffic spikes.
