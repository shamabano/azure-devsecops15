Here are notes for the given Terraform code:

- The code defines a Terraform variable named `storage_account_map` which is expected to be a map. This variable is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet, so its structure and content are assumed to be provided elsewhere in the Terraform configuration.

- The code also defines an Azure Storage Account resource named `example` using the `azurerm_storage_account` resource type.

- The `for_each` argument is used to iterate over the elements of `var.storage_account_map`, creating an instance of the `azurerm_storage_account` resource for each element.

- Inside the resource block, several attributes of the storage account are configured using the `each.value` syntax to access the values of the current element being iterated over.

- The attributes being configured include the `name`, `resource_group_name`, `location`, `account_tier`, and `account_replication_type`.

- Additionally, the resource includes a dynamic block named `network_rules`, which allows for the configuration of network rules for the storage account. The `for_each` argument of the dynamic block iterates over the `network_rules` attribute of each element in `var.storage_account_map`.

- Inside the `network_rules` block, the `default_action` attribute is configured using the `lookup` function to access the value of `default_action` from the `network_rules` attribute of the current element being iterated over. If `default_action` is not present in the `network_rules` attribute, it defaults to `null`.

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the `for_each` meta-argument to create multiple instances of a resource based on the contents of a map variable, and how to use dynamic blocks to handle variable sub-blocks within a resource.
