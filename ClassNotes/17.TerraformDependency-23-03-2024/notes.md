# 1. Implicit and Explicit Dependency in Terraform

In Terraform, dependencies refer to the relationships between resources, where one resource depends on another. These dependencies can be implicit or explicit.

- **Implicit Dependency:** Terraform infers the dependency based on the resource attributes referenced in the configuration. For example, if a virtual machine depends on a virtual network, Terraform will automatically ensure that the virtual network is created before the virtual machine.

- **Explicit Dependency:** You can explicitly define dependencies using the `depends_on` attribute. This attribute takes a list of resources that must be created before the current resource. This is useful when Terraform cannot automatically determine the correct order of resource creation.

## Code Sample - Implicit Dependency Azure Resource Group and Storage Account

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "East US"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "examplestorageaccount"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}
```

In this example, the `azurerm_storage_account` resource depends on the `azurerm_resource_group` resource. Terraform will ensure that the resource group is created before the storage account.

## Code Sample - Explicit Dependency Azure Resource Group and Storage Account

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg5" {
  name     = "rinkiya-ka-beta"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "st5" {
  depends_on               = [azurerm_resource_group.rg5]
  name                     = "devopsinsiders1424"
  resource_group_name      = "rinkiya-ka-beta"
  location                 = "West Europe"
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "GRS"

  tags = {
    environment = "staging"
  }
}
```

# 2. Terraform Folder Structure

Organizing your Terraform configurations into folders can help manage complex projects more effectively. A common structure is to create a separate folder for each type of resource, along with a `provider.tf` file and a `main.tf` file in each folder.

## Example Folder Structure

```
.
├───resource_group
│──────main.tf
│──────provider.tf
└───storage_account
│──────main.tf
│──────provider.tf
```

- **`resource_group/main.tf`:** Contains the Terraform configuration for creating Azure Resource Groups.
- **`resource_group/provider.tf`:** Contains the provider configuration for Azure.
- **`storage_account/main.tf`:** Contains the Terraform configuration for creating Azure Storage Accounts.
- **`storage_account/provider.tf`:** Contains the provider configuration for Azure.

This structure helps in organizing your Terraform code into logical units, making it easier to manage and maintain. Each folder can contain additional Terraform configuration files as needed for the specific resource type.
